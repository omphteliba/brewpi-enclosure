# BrewPi Enclosure
I never liked that my BrewPi Spark and Raspberry Pi were flopping around on top of my fermentation fridge.
It took me years to finally make a box for all of it, including a Power Supply. 

*This is Work In Progress.*

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

* Powersupply: Meanwell RT-65A
* BrewPi Spark
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Power Switch Socket Inlet
* Micro USB cable with 90Â° plug
* 3mm threaded inserts

I use the upper part of this thing to mount the fan on top of the Raspberry Pi: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3743755
